                              CHAPTER 1
                             INTRODUCTION


1.1 Background Information

EchoMateLite is a comprehensive college project aimed at developing a modern social media 
platform that demonstrates contemporary web development practices and cloud deployment 
capabilities. The project addresses the growing need for students to gain practical, 
hands-on experience with fundamental AWS services, full-stack development principles, 
and cloud deployment techniques that are essential in today's technology industry.

The platform is designed to solve several critical challenges in modern application 
development:

User Authentication and Security:
Modern applications require robust authentication systems that protect user data while 
providing seamless user experiences. Students need to understand how to implement secure 
login systems with proper password hashing using bcrypt and token-based authentication 
using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). EchoMateLite addresses this by implementing industry-
standard security practices including secure password storage, session management, and 
protected API routes.

Social Interaction Features:
The platform provides essential social media functionalities including user profiles, 
content creation, and social engagement features. Users can create posts, like content, 
follow other users, and engage in social networking activities. This demonstrates the 
implementation of complex data relationships and real-time user interactions.

Real-time Content Management:
Users require the ability to create, view, and interact with posts in real-time. The 
platform includes features for content discovery through public timelines showing all 
posts and personalized feeds displaying content from followed users. This demonstrates 
efficient data querying and content filtering strategies.

Profile Management:
Users need comprehensive profile management capabilities allowing them to create, edit, 
and maintain their personal information and social connections. The platform implements 
full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user profiles, including bio 
information, follower/following relationships, and user metadata.

Scalable Architecture:
The solution demonstrates scalable architecture patterns suitable for cloud deployment, 
particularly on AWS infrastructure. The architecture is designed to be cost-effective 
for educational purposes while maintaining professional-grade practices that can scale 
to production environments.

Full-Stack Integration:
The project requires seamless integration between frontend and backend components, 
demonstrating proper API design, data flow management, and state management principles. 
The separation of concerns between presentation layer (Next.js), application logic 
(Express.js), and data persistence (MongoDB) follows industry best practices.

Educational Context:
EchoMateLite addresses the educational need for students to gain hands-on experience 
with modern web development and cloud computing technologies. Traditional academic 
projects often lack the complexity and real-world applicability required to prepare 
students for industry challenges. This project bridges that gap by simulating real-world 
development scenarios including user management, content creation, social interactions, 
and scalable architecture design.

The platform demonstrates the integration of frontend frameworks (Next.js with React), 
backend APIs (Express.js with Node.js), database management (MongoDB), and cloud 
services (AWS). It provides students with exposure to the complete software development 
lifecycle including planning, implementation, testing, and deployment strategies.

                              CHAPTER 2
                          LITERATURE REVIEW


2.1 Review of Similar Projects and Platforms

The social media landscape includes several established platforms that provide context 
for the EchoMateLite project. Understanding these platforms helps identify best 
practices, common features, and areas for differentiation.

Twitter/X Platform:
Twitter (now X) represents the microblogging concept that inspired EchoMateLite's post 
character limit approach. Key features include 280-character posts, real-time feeds, 
user following systems, and engagement through likes and retweets. While Twitter 
operates at massive scale with complex recommendation algorithms and advertisement 
systems, EchoMateLite focuses on core social networking features suitable for 
educational demonstration, emphasizing clean architecture and modern development 
practices over complex algorithmic feeds.

Facebook Platform:
Facebook demonstrates comprehensive social networking with user profiles, content 
sharing, commenting systems, and complex friend relationship management. The platform 
utilizes React (developed by Facebook) for its frontend, validating our choice of 
React-based Next.js. However, Facebook's complexity with multiple content types, groups, 
pages, and marketplace features extends far beyond EchoMateLite's scope. Our project 
focuses on essential social features while maintaining simplicity and clarity for 
educational purposes.

Instagram Platform:
Instagram emphasizes visual content sharing with photo and video posts, stories, and 
reels. While Instagram's mobile-first approach and visual focus differ from 
EchoMateLite's text-centric design, both platforms share common social features like 
user following, likes, comments, and profile management. EchoMateLite's responsive 
design using Tailwind CSS ensures mobile compatibility while focusing on text-based 
content sharing.

LinkedIn Platform:
LinkedIn combines professional networking with content sharing, demonstrating enterprise-
grade social media architecture. The platform's use of microservices architecture and 
cloud infrastructure validates our AWS deployment approach. LinkedIn's professional 
focus differs from EchoMateLite's general social networking purpose, but both emphasize 
secure authentication, profile management, and meaningful content sharing.

Major platforms use proprietary technologies and closed-source codebases. EchoMateLite 
uses widely-adopted open-source technologies (MERN stack, Next.js), enabling students 
to replicate, modify, and learn from the implementation. Every technology choice is 
justified and documented for educational purposes.

Cloud Deployment Accessibility:
While established platforms use complex, proprietary infrastructure costing millions 
annually, EchoMateLite demonstrates cost-effective AWS deployment suitable for student 
budgets. Using AWS free tier and MongoDB Atlas free tier, students can deploy and 
maintain the platform with minimal costs while learning production-grade cloud 
practices.

Simplified Architecture:
EchoMateLite intentionally avoids complexity like microservices architecture, caching 
layers, content delivery networks, and recommendation algorithms. Instead, it focuses on 
fundamental three-tier architecture (presentation, application, data) that provides 
solid foundation for understanding web application structure before advancing to complex 
patterns.

`

3.5 Database Schema Design

The MongoDB database uses three main collections with the following schemas:

User Schema:
`javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,              // Unique identifier (auto-generated)
  username: String,           // Unique username (required, indexed)
  email: String,              // Email address (required, unique, indexed)
  password: String,           // Hashed password (bcrypt, required)
  fullName: String,           // User's full name (required)
  bio: String,                // User biography (optional, max 160 chars)
  followers: [ObjectId],      // Array of user IDs following this user
  following: [ObjectId],      // Array of user IDs this user follows
  createdAt: Date,            // Account creation timestamp (auto)
  updatedAt: Date             // Last update timestamp (auto)
}
`

Post Schema:
`javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,              // Unique identifier (auto-generated)
  content: String,            // Post content (required, max 280 chars)
  author: ObjectId,           // Reference to User _id (required, indexed)
  likes: [ObjectId],          // Array of user IDs who liked the post
  createdAt: Date,            // Post creation timestamp (auto)
  updatedAt: Date             // Last update timestamp (auto)
}
`

Indexes:
- User.username: Unique index for fast username lookups
- User.email: Unique index for email validation and login
- Post.author: Index for efficient author-based queries
- Post.createdAt: Index for chronological sorting

Relationships:
- One-to-Many: User  Posts (one user creates many posts)
- Many-to-Many: User  Followers  User (users follow other users)
- Many-to-Many: User  Likes  Post (users like multiple posts)

Design Rationale:
The schema design prioritizes query performance for common operations like fetching user 
timelines, retrieving follower lists, and displaying post likes. Using embedded arrays 
for followers, following, and likes provides fast read operations typical in social 
media applications. The denormalized approach trades some storage efficiency for query 
performance, appropriate for read-heavy social media workloads.

- Total: ~/month

4.4 Architectural Decisions and Justifications

Decision 1: Three-Tier Architecture
Rationale: Separation of concerns between presentation, application, and data layers 
provides modularity, making it easier to scale, maintain, and update individual 
components independently. This pattern is industry-standard and teaches fundamental 
architectural principles.

Trade-offs: More complex than monolithic architecture but provides better scalability 
and maintainability. The additional complexity is justified by educational value and 
real-world applicability.

Decision 2: Stateless Authentication with JWT
Rationale: JWT tokens eliminate need for server-side session storage, enabling 
horizontal scaling without session synchronization complexity. Tokens contain all 
necessary authentication information, reducing database queries.

Trade-offs: Token revocation is challenging compared to session-based authentication. 
However, the benefits for scalability and simplicity outweigh this limitation for the 
project's scope.

Decision 3: NoSQL (MongoDB) over SQL
Rationale: MongoDB's flexible schema accommodates evolving data requirements without 
complex migrations. Document-based storage naturally represents social media entities 
(users, posts) as JSON objects, aligning with JavaScript/TypeScript development.

Trade-offs: Less rigid data constraints compared to SQL, requiring careful application-
level validation. However, flexibility and performance for read-heavy workloads make 
MongoDB ideal for social media applications.

Decision 4: AWS EC2 over Serverless (Lambda)
Rationale: EC2 provides consistent compute environment suitable for both frontend SSR 
and backend API. Free tier offers generous allowances for educational projects. Students 
gain experience with traditional server deployment before advancing to serverless.

Trade-offs: Requires more infrastructure management than serverless options. However, 
the learning value and cost-effectiveness justify this choice for educational contexts.

Decision 5: Application Load Balancer (Optional)
Rationale: ALB provides production-grade traffic distribution, health checks, and SSL 
termination. While optional for development, it demonstrates enterprise deployment 
patterns and high availability architecture.

Trade-offs: Additional cost (~/month) may not be justified for low-traffic 
educational projects. Can be implemented selectively when demonstrating production 
deployment concepts.

Future Scaling Considerations:

Horizontal Scaling: Architecture supports adding more EC2 instances behind load 
balancer as traffic grows, distributing load across multiple servers.

Caching Layer: Redis or ElastiCache can be added for session caching and frequently 
accessed data, reducing database load and improving response times.

Content Delivery Network: CloudFront integration can accelerate static asset delivery 
globally, reducing latency for geographically distributed users.

Database Optimization: MongoDB supports sharding for horizontal database scaling, while 
read replicas can handle increased read operations.

Microservices Evolution: Current monolithic backend can evolve into microservices 
architecture as complexity grows, separating authentication, user management, and post 
management into independent services.

                              CHAPTER 5
                           IMPLEMENTATION


5.1 Implementation Overview

The EchoMateLite platform implementation follows a systematic approach, building 
features incrementally from core authentication to advanced social networking 
capabilities. The implementation phase spanned multiple iterations, with each iteration 
adding functionality while maintaining code quality and security standards.

Implementation Timeline:

Week 1-2: Foundation Setup
- Project initialization with Next.js and Express.js
- Database connection and schema definition
- Basic authentication system implementation
- Development environment configuration

Week 3-4: Core Features
- User registration and login functionality
- Profile management implementation
- Post creation and retrieval
- Basic UI components with Tailwind CSS

Week 5-6: Social Features
- User following system
- Post likes functionality
- Timeline and feed implementation
- Real-time updates integration

Week 7-8: Refinement and Testing
- Security hardening and validation
- UI/UX improvements

5.2 Implemented Features and Modules

Module 1: Authentication System

Features Implemented:
- User Registration with validation
- User Login with JWT token generation
- Password hashing using bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
- Protected route middleware
- Token-based session management

Backend Authentication Implementation:
The authentication module provides secure user registration and login using JWT tokens
and bcrypt password hashing. All passwords are hashed with 10 salt rounds before 
storage. JWT tokens expire after 7 days and contain the user ID for session management.

Frontend Authentication Integration:
React Context API manages authentication state across the application. The AuthContext
provider wraps the application, making user state and authentication functions available
to all components. Protected routes redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

[NOTE: Implementation screenshots should capture AWS Console with Account ID visible,
showing EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and deployed application interface]

Module 2: User Profile Management

Features Implemented:
- View user profile with posts count and follower statistics
- Edit profile information (fullName, bio)
- View followers and following lists
- Profile picture support (ready for S3 integration)

Implementation Details:
User profiles display comprehensive information including bio, follower/following 
counts, and post statistics. The edit profile functionality allows users to update 
their full name and bio text (max 160 characters). Profile data is fetched via 
protected API endpoints requiring authentication.

Module 3: Post Creation and Management

Features Implemented:
- Create posts with 280-character limit
- View individual posts with author information
- Delete own posts
- Real-time post creation feedback
- Character counter during post composition

Implementation Details:
Posts are created through a simple text input with real-time character validation. 
The frontend prevents submission of posts exceeding 280 characters. Each post displays
author information, creation timestamp, and engagement metrics (likes count).

Module 4: Social Interaction Features

Features Implemented:
- Follow/unfollow other users
- Like/unlike posts
- View follower and following lists
- Engagement statistics on profiles

Implementation Details:
The following system uses MongoDB array operations to add/remove user IDs from 
followers and following arrays. Like functionality similarly uses array operations
on the post likes array. All operations are atomic to prevent race conditions.

Module 5: Timeline and Feed System

Features Implemented:
- Public timeline showing all posts chronologically
- Personalized feed showing posts from followed users
- Real-time feed updates
- Infinite scroll support (ready for pagination)

Implementation Details:
The public timeline queries all posts sorted by creation date (descending). The 
personalized feed queries posts where the author is in the current user's following 
array. Both feeds include populated author information for display.

6.2 Technical Challenges and Solutions

Challenge 1: JWT Token Management
Problem: Initial implementation stored tokens in localStorage, vulnerable to XSS attacks.
Solution: Migrated to HTTP-only cookies for secure token storage. Implemented automatic
token refresh mechanism to maintain user sessions securely.

Challenge 2: Real-Time UI Updates
Problem: After creating posts or following users, UI didn't reflect changes immediately.
Solution: Implemented optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure. Used React state
management to update UI immediately while API request processes in background.

Challenge 3: CORS Configuration
Problem: Frontend and backend on different ports caused CORS errors during development.
Solution: Configured Express CORS middleware to allow specific origins. Set credentials:
true for cookie-based authentication. Documented CORS setup for production deployment.

Challenge 4: AWS Free Tier Limitations
Problem: Free tier t3.micro instances have limited CPU and memory for full stack app.
Solution: Optimized application bundle sizes, implemented code splitting, and configured
PM2 for efficient process management. Separated frontend and backend on different instances.

Challenge 5: Database Query Performance
Problem: Timeline queries became slow with increased post volume during testing.
Solution: Created indexes on User and Post models (email, username, createdAt fields).
Implemented query optimization using MongoDB aggregation pipeline. Prepared pagination
logic for production scaling.
